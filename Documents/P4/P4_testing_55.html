          <h2>3. Testing Document</h2>
      </header>
      <p> We completed the testing in the last phase of finishing the website. We made a google form with the following questions: </p>

      <ul>
        <li> What type of device did you use? </li>
        <li> What was your first impression of the page? </li>
        <li> If this was a real cafe and you wanted to visit it. Did you get all the needed information about the cafe on the website? </li>
        <li> Did you find it difficult to navigate on the website? </li>
        <li> Did you miss anything on the website? </li>
      </ul>

      <p> By asking this questions, we first of all wanted to test out exactly how user friendly our website is, according to our test audience. Secondly, we also wanted an opinion on the aesthetical aspect of the webpage and if there was something the users were missing. </p>

      <p> We also completed live testing based on the same questions we used in the form. The live-test audience could also comment during the testing. </p>

          <h2>4. Tester Audience</h2>
      </header>

      <p> We sent the google form to friends and family to collect information from a wide range of audience. When completing the live testing we also got to test the website on people with different age. We received 22 answers from the Google Form and managed to complete live testing on 4 people (ages 18-57 years). </p>

          <h2>5. Testing Platforms</h2>
      </header>

      <p> In the google form we sent out we asked the test audience what kind of mobile device they used. Most of the them used a computer, but some used a smartphone. </p>

      <p> Our live test audience used one of our computers (MacBook Pro with Google Chrome). </p>

          <h2>6. Feedback Summary</h2>
      </header>
      <p> We have chosen to divide the “Feedback summary”-part into four parts. Navigation, design, content and usability. Furthermore, we chose to merge the feedback from the google form and the feedback from the live testing. The reasoning for this is that the feedbacks consists of the same elements. </p>

      <h3> Navigation </h3>
      <p> Overall the test audience thought the navigation on the website worked perfectly fine. Some commented that it was easy to know where to click to get the information the needed, and that the buttons were easy to read. They also liked the hovering effect. </p>

      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p> Everyone who tested the website said that they were happy about the design. They liked the clean and minimalistic design and thought it fit to the concept of the cafe.  </p>
      <p> Here are some of the comments we received regarding the design:  </p>
      <p> “Elegant website” </p>
      <p> “It looks like a professional restaurant”  </p>
      <p> “Stylish design. Looks professional and attractive” </p>

      <h3> Content </h3>
      <p> People were generally happy about the content of the page. Most comments included that they found what they needed. One of the people in the test audience misses a description of the room of the cafe. Another comment says that it would be positive if the website included pictures of the cafe. This is information we could have included in the “Information”-part. </p>

      <h3> Usability </h3>
      <p> As mentioned above, people are satisfied about the website. Based on the comments, the website seems to be user friendly and the users are not having problems finding the information they are seeking. According to the feedback, it seems like the design also have an effect on how the users experiences the usability of the page.  </p>

          <h2>7. Your Response</h2>
      </header>
      <p> Most of the feedback we have received from our testing audience consists of the design, usability and the content of the page. According to the comments, our test audience are satisfied with the design and they regarded the website as visually appealing. Some of the comments pointed out that they were missing some information and pictures of the cafe. This is something we could have considered adding to the “Information”-page.  </p>

      <p> When we started this project we wanted to create a website with a clean and elegant design. Usability has also been important for us through this project. We are therefore happy to receive comments feedback about how the users like the design, navigation and usability. </p>

          <h2>8. Self-reflection</h2>
      </header>
      <p> Through this project, we have learned a lot about making a website from scratch. We have had many ups and downs, and at times it has been hard to figure out what the best course of action is. None of the group members have had any experience with making websites before, so this has been very educational for all of us. </p>

      <p> Taking everything into account, we are satisfied about the final product. Regarding the feedback, our test audience are satisfied as well. There are things we could have considered adding to the page, so this is something to have in mind for any future projects of this kind.  </p>
